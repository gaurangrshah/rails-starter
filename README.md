# README

use with gitpod:
```
https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/gaurangrshah/rails-starter
```

to use locally: 
```
git clone git@github.com:gaurangrshah/rails-starter.git .
```

When using locally you must comment out the following whitelisting (which was added for gitpod)
```ruby
# app/config/environments/development.rb
  # Whitelist one hostname
  config.hosts << "3000-ac200ee9-27ed-424d-9c71-fd9090907aca.ws-us02.gitpod.io"
```
